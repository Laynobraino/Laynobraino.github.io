							<p>My project is to create an encrypted messaging app that makes it easier to communicate with people in other time zones.  My idea is to incorporate a clock into the actual message screen that displays what time it is for the other person. The app will also give a warning if the user attempts to send a message during night hours or during a designated quiet time for the receiving user. </p>

							<p>Many of us have made friends online with the help of the internet, and many more of us have family in different places all over the world. It can be difficult to find the right time to message them to ensure that we do not disturb them during something important. With my sister having recently moved to England it has really opened my eyes to a need for such an application. I have on multiple occasions sent her a message and woken her up in the middle of the night by accident because Iâ€™m still used to having my sister be in the same time zone. </p>
