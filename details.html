							<h1 class="major">INFJ, Tactile/Kinestic learner, Melancholic , Ravenclaw</h1>
							<span class="image"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>INFJ stands for Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling and Judging. The INFJ personality type is allegedly the rarest personality type, making up less than one percent of the population, and is known as 'The Advocate'. Those with the INFJ personality type are known for doing whatever they can to help those around them. They are known to be perfectionists, kind hearted and very compaasionate. The Advocate does not long for power but would rather see everyone succeed. This means that in a team environment I will complete whatever task has been set to me quickly and to a very high standard, before moving on to help the others in my team achieve a similar standard. At first I might appear quiet and timid but once my team gets to know me, they will see that I will be a fun and vital part of the team. When forming a team it would be very wise to include someone of the INFJ personality type as they are generally quite skilled at diffusing tensions and disagreements.</p>
							<p>A Tactile/Kinestic learner is someone who learns best while keeping their mind in constant activity, whether this be listening to music, fidgeting or using a keyboard to take notes. In a team setting I'd be able to quickly learn from others in my team as just engaing with them hits the active requirement. A conversation with coworkers would allow me to quickly understand the problems they are facing. When forming a team with a Tactile/Kinestic learner it may be smart to provide an environment in which they could keep themselves active and focused.</p>
							<p>Those with a Melancholic temperament are fundamentally introverted and thoughtful. They are known to be considerate and extremly punctual. In a team sense this would mean that I am always on time and am helpful and accomadating with others. When forming a team with someone with a melancholic temperament it might be best to ensure that they have a clear idea of what they must do so that their perfectionism can be fully utilised. </p>
