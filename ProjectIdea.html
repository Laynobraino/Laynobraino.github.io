							<p>My project is to create an encrypted messaging app that makes it easier to communicate with people in other time zones.  My idea is to incorporate a clock into the actual message screen that displays what time it is for the other person. The app will also give a warning if the user attempts to send a message during night hours or during a designated quiet time for the receiving user. </p>

							<p>Many of us have made friends online with the help of the internet, and many more of us have family in different places all over the world. It can be difficult to find the right time to message them to ensure that we do not disturb them during something important. With my sister having recently moved to England it has really opened my eyes to a need for such an application. I have on multiple occasions sent her a message and woken her up in the middle of the night by accident because I’m still used to having my sister be in the same time zone. </p>
							<p>The project will be delivered in the form of a mobile app with secure end to end encryption. When the app is first opened it will ask for your time zone and allow you to add your usual sleep hours as well as any other designated quiet hours in which you would prefer to not receive messages. If someone attempts to message you during these hours, it will give them a warning before allowing them to send the message. When a new conversation is started it will display the time in both participants’ time zones next to your message so that it will be easy to see. Once the message has been sent the chat window will display their time when they sent it as well as your own time when you received it so that you can understand what situation they might have been in when they sent the message.</p>
							<p>The skills needed to create such a program includes an understanding of how to safely encrypt messages, basic programming skills, an understanding of user-centered design. Software would need to be written to keep all user data secure as well as to keep track of time zones and calendars. Server computers would be a vital piece of hardware required to ensure that no matter how many users the app sees it will still be able to function </p>
